Each NPC the player is on a date with will have their own "brain" with
their own sentiments on predetermined subjects that will arise in the scene.
Subjects that arise are handled by a manager.

NPC Brain Example:

<npc>
    <name>NPC_1</name>
    <question>
        <q_name>q_1</q_name>
        <intent>I don't really like this...</intent>
        <intent>I'm not a huge fan, to be honest!</intent>
        <intent>This tastes like gym socks.</intent>
        <literal>I like it!</literal>
        <literal>I'm so into this!</literal>
        <literal>It's like heaven in my mouth!</literal>
    </question>
</npc>

The 6-tuple model of sarcasm (Ivanko and Pexman, 2003) provides a useful starting point for understanding 
the structure of sarcastic statements. Defined as <p’, p, u, c, h, s>:
	P’ : intended proposition
	P : literal proposition
	U : utterance
	C : context
	H : hearer/listener 
	S : speaker

The example used in Automatic Sarcasm Detection: A Survey illustrates this well:

The tuple can be read as ‘Speaker S generates an utterance u in Context C meaning proposition p but intending that hearer H understands p’. 
Consider the following example. If a teacher says to a student, “That’s how assignments should be done!” 
and if the student knows that (s)he has barely completed the assignment, the student would understand the sarcasm. 
In context of the 6-tuple above, the properties of this sarcasm would be:
S: Teacher, H: Student
C: The student has not completed his/her assignment.
u: “That’s how assignments should be done!”
p: You have done a good job at the assignment.
p’: You have done a bad job at the assignment.
